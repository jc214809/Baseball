If you have nodejs installed, you can download an http server: 
1) Change directories to the directory where you want to serve files from: $ cd ~/angular_projects/1app 
2) If you are using nvm: $ nvm use 0.10 (specifies the version of nodejs to activate) 
3) Download and install the server as a command line command: npm install http-server -g 
4) Run the server: $ http-server ., which will produce the message Starting up http-server, serving . on: http://0.0.0.0:8080. That allows you to use urls in your browser like localhost:8080/index.html.
